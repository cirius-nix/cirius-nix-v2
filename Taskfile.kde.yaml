    summary: |
      This is caused by a stale QML cache (https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/177720). A dirty way to fix this is by running on a terminal the following command: 
    cmds:
      - find ${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/**/qmlcache -type f -delete
  list:plasmoid:

    cmds:
      - inotifywait -m ~/.config
